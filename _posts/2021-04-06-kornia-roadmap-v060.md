## Roadmap Kornia v0.6.0 announcement

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/kornia_banner.png)

Hello `KORNIANS` !

After the release of *Kornia v0.5.0*, we are pleased to announce that we are striking back with new ideas for future releases.

For this reason, we have published our public **Kornia v0.6.0** [[**ROADMAP**]](https://github.com/kornia/kornia/issues/930)

In the upcoming release we will target the following high level features:

- Improve `kornia.augmentations` and refactor the backend pipeline to support Torchscript.
- Improve `kornia.color` module adding more functionality with losses.
- Add `kornia.nn` module to wrap functionals as torch modules.

Feel free to volunteer yourself if you are interested in trying out some items (they do not have to be on the list).

Please, take also a read on the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/kornia/kornia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst) notes.

Stay tuned and have a happy coding day ! :sunglasses:

**The Kornia team**
