The [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/) is hosting the Kornia Hackathon 2019 on December 14th as a satellite event of the [Deep Learning Symposium Barcelona](https://sites.google.com/view/dlbcn2019). The aim of the event is a **hands-on in differentiable computer vision with PyTorch** session with two of the Kornia project leaders, Edgar Riba and Dmytro Mishkin.

[Edgar Riba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edgarriba/) is one of the main promoters of Kornia, member of the Open Source Vision foundation and OpenCV technical committee member. He is currently finishing his PhD at the UPC on ‘Geometric Computer Vision and Local Features detection’. On the other hand, [Dmytro Mishkin](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~mishkdmy/), also a Kornia promoter, is currently a PhD student at the Centre for Machine Perception of the Czech Technical University in Prague. Furthermore, Dmytro is the ex-CTO of Clear Research, the co-founder of the Ukrainian Research Group “Szkocka”, co-founder of the Eastern European Computer Vision Conference (EECVC) and Kaggle Master.

The Hackathon will start at 10.00 and finish at 18.00. The full program will be released soon. The Hackathon is sponsored by [OpenCV.org](https://opencv.org/), the [OSVF.org](http://osvf.org/), the [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/). All twitter promotion will be available under the hashtag [#HackathonKornia19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HackathonKornia19?src=hashtag_click).

**Technical requirements**

A solid knowledge of PyTorch, Computer Vision and Deep Learning would be ideal. All the attendees should bring their own laptop. Internet connection will be provided.

**Registration**
