            "title": "Kornia v0.4.0 release",
            "content": "Kornia team is happy to announce the release for v0.4.0. . We are releasing a new version for Kornia that includes different functionalities to work with 3D augmentations and volumetric data, local features matching, homographies and epipolar geometry. . In short, we list the following new features: . Support for PyTorch v1.6.0. | Local descriptors matching, homography and epipolar geometry API. | 3D augmentations and low-level API to work with volumetric data. | . Local features matching . We include an kornia.feature.matching API to perform local descriptors matching such classical and derived version of the nearest neighbor (NN). . . import torch import kornia as K desc1 = torch.rand(2500, 128) desc2 = torch.rand(2500, 128) dists, idxs = K.feature.matching.match_nn(desc1, desc2) # 2500 / 2500x2 . Homography and epipolar geometry . We also introduce kornia.geometry.homography including different functionalities to work with homographies and differentiable estimators based on the DLT formulation and the iteratively-reweighted least squares (IRWLS). . . import torch import kornia as K pts1 = torch.rand(1, 8, 2) pts2 = torch.rand(1, 8, 2) H = K.find_homography_dlt(pts1, pts2, weights=torch.rand(1, 8)) # 1x3x3 . In addition, we have ported some of the existing algorithms from opencv.sfm to PyTorch under kornia.geometry.epipolar that includes different functionalities to work with Fundamental, Essential or Projection matrices, and Triangulation methods useful for Structure from Motion problems. . 3D augmentations and volumetric . We expand the kornia.augmentaion with a series of operators to perform 3D augmentations for volumetric data. . . In this release, we include the following first set of geometric 3D augmentations methods: . RandomDepthicalFlip3D (along depth axis) | RandomVerticalFlip3D (along height axis) | RandomHorizontalFlip3D (along width axis) | RandomRotation3D | RandomAffine3D | . The API for 3D augmentation work same as with 2D image augmentations: . import torch import kornia as K x = torch.eye(3).repeat(3, 1, 1) aug = K.augmentation.RandomVerticalFlip3D(p=1.0) print(aug(x)) tensor([[[[[0., 0., 1.], [0., 1., 0.], [1., 0., 0.]], &lt;BLANKLINE&gt; [[0., 0., 1.], [0., 1., 0.], [1., 0., 0.]], &lt;BLANKLINE&gt; [[0., 0., 1.], [0., 1., 0.], [1., 0., 0.]]]]]) . Finally, we also introduce a low level API to perform 4D features transformations kornia.warp_projective and extending the filtering operators to support 3D kernels kornia.filter3D. . More 2d operators . We expand as well the list of the 2D image augmentations based on the paper AutoAugment: Learning Augmentation Policies from Data. . Solarize | Posterize | Sharpness | Equalize | RandomSolarize | RandomPosterize | RandomShaprness | RandomEqualize | . . Please, do not hesitate to check the release notes on GitHub to learn about the new library features and get more details. . Have a happy coding day :sunglasses: . The Kornia team .",

            "content": ". The Computer Vision Center is hosting the Kornia Hackathon 2019 on December 14th as a satellite event of the Deep Learning Symposium Barcelona. The aim of the event is a hands-on in differentiable computer vision with PyTorch session with two of the Kornia project leaders, Edgar Riba and Dmytro Mishkin. . Edgar Riba is one of the main promoters of Kornia, member of the Open Source Vision foundation and OpenCV technical committee member. He is currently finishing his PhD at the UPC on ‘Geometric Computer Vision and Local Features detection’. On the other hand, Dmytro Mishkin, also a Kornia promoter, is currently a PhD student at the Centre for Machine Perception of the Czech Technical University in Prague. Furthermore, Dmytro is the ex-CTO of Clear Research, the co-founder of the Ukrainian Research Group “Szkocka”, co-founder of the Eastern European Computer Vision Conference (EECVC) and Kaggle Master. . The Hackathon will start at 10.00 and finish at 18.00. The full program will be released soon. The Hackathon is sponsored by OpenCV.org, the OSVF.org, the Computer Vision Center, PyTorch and AWS. All twitter promotion will be available under the hashtag #HackathonKornia19. . Technical requirements . A solid knowledge of PyTorch, Computer Vision and Deep Learning would be ideal. All the attendees should bring their own laptop. Internet connection will be provided. . Registration . Registration is open until December 12th here: https://forms.gle/xRGw1k6njDzthRkB6 . About Kornia . Kornia is an open source Computer Vision library for PyTorch. More information on the projecte here: https://kornia.org . Any queries must be directed to edgar.riba@osvf.org .",
